/**
 * Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.
 * <p>
 * Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.
 * <p>
 * Each node in the graph contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.
 * <p>
 * class Node {
 * public int val;
 * public List<Node> neighbors;
 * }
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Test case format:
 * <p>
 * For simplicity sake, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val = 1, the second node with val = 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.
 * <p>
 * Adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.
 * <p>
 * The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
 * Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
 * Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
 * 1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
 * 2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
 * 3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
 * 4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
